# FurryBot
Grabs pictures from e621 and posts to discord.

The bot will respond to any message starting with "!~". All following text will be interpreted as tags, using normal e621 syntax. In SFW channels only safe and verified pictures will be posted.

Maybe if I'm bored and motivated I will add an easier method of sorting and a way to have server blocklists that can be changed using commands in discord.
